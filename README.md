# Golang Katas

I wanted to do some coding katas to help me get better at algorithms. Since AI will steal my job one day, I thought I'd get it to help me prolong my employment by creating the tool.

I didn't vibe code it, I wanted it to use Golang compiled to WASM and I wanted the end result to be one single file.

I decided to use [Yaegi](https://github.com/traefik/yaegi) so I can compile Go code and then got it to generate the code accordingly. I had a look at it and manually made a few changes but on the whole it worked quite well.
